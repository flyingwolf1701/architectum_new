## Understanding the Role-Based Organization

The BMAD Method is organized by role, with each role having its own dedicated folder in the `bmad-method/roles/` directory. This makes it easy for each agent to access everything they need:

- Each role folder (e.g., `roles/3-architect/`) contains:
  - The primary role definition markdown file (e.g., `3-architect.md`)
  - Role-specific checklists (e.g., `architect-checklist.txt`)
  - Role-specific templates (e.g., `architecture-tmpl.txt`)
  - Any other supporting files needed by that role

This organization ensures that when an agent operates in a specific role, everything required for that role is conveniently grouped together.

## Web Agent Setup in Claude

To set up web-mode agents in Claude, use the table below. It outlines the agent name, the source file for its description, and the checklist/template files needed for that agent.

| Agent Name         | Description File Path                  | Supporting Files                                                                                                                                       |

## Claude Desktop Setup

When using Claude Desktop application for BMAD Method:

1. **Setting Up Agent Roles**:
   - Create a new chat for each role you need to work with
   - Upload the role's primary markdown file and its supporting files to the chat
   - For example, to set up the Architect agent:
     - Create a new chat
     - Upload `roles/3-architect/3-architect.md`
     - Upload `roles/3-architect/architecture-tmpl.txt` and `roles/3-architect/architect-checklist.txt`
     - Begin the conversation by asking Claude to operate in the role defined by the uploaded documents

2. **Working Across Roles**:
   - Maintain separate chats for each role to keep contexts clean
   - Use the Project Brief or PRD generated by one agent as input for the next agent in the workflow
   - For document handoff between agents:
     - Download the output document from the previous agent's chat
     - Upload it to the next agent's chat along with appropriate context

3. **Document Management**:
   - Claude Desktop allows downloading of text content and artifacts
   - Use this feature to save key documents between sessions
   - Maintain a local folder structure that mirrors the BMAD Method organization for consistency

## Tasks

Tasks in V3 are designed to reduce the need for specialized agents. These task prompts can be found in the `tasks/` folder.

To use a task with any agent:
1. Copy the content of the task file (e.g., `tasks/create-next-story-task.md`)
2. Paste it into the chat with any capable agent
3. The agent will execute the specific task regardless of its primary role

This approach is particularly useful for one-off operations that don't require creating a dedicated agent mode.
