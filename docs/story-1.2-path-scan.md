# Story 1.2: Implement Basic Path Scan and Representation Generation

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As an AI agent (via Architectum)
- I want to request a path scan and have both representations generated
- So that I can access both navigation-focused and content-focused views of a specified directory

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1 (Core Blueprint Generation Framework) must be completed
- Relationship Map and JSON Mirrors models must be implemented and tested
- Basic CLI structure must be in place
- Parser interfaces must be defined

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Given a valid directory path and depth, the system generates both a Relationship Map and JSON Mirrors for the path structure.
- AC2: Given an invalid directory path, the system returns an appropriate error.
- AC3: The Relationship Map correctly represents nested structures of directories and files with "contains" relationships.
- AC4: The JSON Mirrors structure correctly contains JSON representations for each source file.
- AC5: Scan depth 0 correctly scans all subdirectories and files.
- AC6: Scan depth 1 correctly scans only the immediate files and folders in the specified directory.
- AC7: Test coverage must reach minimum 80% for the path traversal and representation generation functionality.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement path traversal functionality (AC: 1, 5, 6)
  - [ ] Create function to recursively scan directories
  - [ ] Implement depth control mechanism
  - [ ] Add file type detection
- [ ] Implement relationship map generation for directories (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create node representations for directories and files
  - [ ] Establish "contains" relationships between parent directories and their contents
  - [ ] Ensure proper nesting of relationships
- [ ] Implement JSON mirror generation for files (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Create JSON structure for each source file
  - [ ] Extract basic file information
  - [ ] Store mirrors in appropriate location
- [ ] Implement error handling for invalid paths (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add validation for directory paths
  - [ ] Create appropriate error messages
  - [ ] Implement graceful failure
- [ ] Implement comprehensive tests (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Create test fixtures with mock file systems
  - [ ] Test with various directory structures
  - [ ] Test with varying depth parameters
  - [ ] Test error conditions
  - [ ] Verify test coverage meets 80% minimum requirement
  - [ ] Generate and review coverage report

## Dev Technical Guidance

- Use mock file systems for testing to avoid external dependencies
- Ensure consistent handling of path separators across operating systems
- Use the pathlib library for path manipulations
- Consider performance implications for large directory structures
- Implement directory scanning as an iterator for memory efficiency
- Use proper error handling and validation

### Agent Model Used: `Claude 3.7 Sonnet`

### Completion Notes List
- None yet

### Change Log
- Initial draft created
- Updated terminology from "directory scan" to "path scan" for consistency
