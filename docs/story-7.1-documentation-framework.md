# Story E7.1: Implement Documentation Framework and API Reference

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a developer
- I want comprehensive API documentation for Architectum
- So that I can understand how to use the library and extend its functionality

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1 (Core Blueprint Generation Framework) must be completed
- Basic module structure must be established
- Core APIs must be defined

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Documentation generation framework (Sphinx) is properly set up
- AC2: API documentation is automatically generated from docstrings
- AC3: Core modules have comprehensive docstrings
- AC4: Documentation includes examples for common use cases
- AC5: Documentation can be built as HTML and PDF
- AC6: CLI commands are documented with examples
- AC7: Test coverage must reach minimum 80% for documentation utilities

## Dev Technical Guidance

- Use Google-style docstrings for consistency
- Ensure docstrings include type annotations
- Document both parameters and return values
- Include exceptions that may be raised
- Add practical examples for complex functionality
- Maintain a consistent voice and terminology throughout documentation
- Keep examples focused and minimal
