# Story 1.1: Setup Blueprint Generation Core Module with Dual Representation Model

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a system architect
- I want a core module for blueprint generation established with both a Relationship Map model and JSON Mirrors structure
- So that different blueprint types can be developed and integrated in a consistent and maintainable manner within the existing Architectum repository

## Dependencies

- None (this is the first story of the project)

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: ✅ The new module/package `arch_blueprint_generator` is created within the `Architectum` repository and is buildable/integrable with the main project.
- AC2: ✅ The Relationship Map model is implemented with support for nodes, relationships, and efficient navigation.
- AC3: ✅ The JSON Mirrors structure is implemented with the ability to create and access JSON representations of source files.
- AC4: ✅ Basic operations for both representations are functional and can be used independently.
- AC5: ✅ A placeholder CLI command or API endpoint exists and returns a "not yet implemented" message or basic help.
- AC6: ✅ Basic logging for module initialization and errors is functional with color-coded output.
- AC7: ✅ The module includes a README with an overview of the dual representation approach.
- AC8: ✅ Test coverage reaches at least 80% for both representation models and core operations.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude 3.7 Sonnet`

### Completion Notes List
- Successfully implemented the dual representation approach with the Relationship Map model and JSON Mirrors structure
- Created comprehensive class hierarchies for nodes and relationships with proper type hints
- Implemented efficient navigation and querying operations in the Relationship Map
- Added serialization/deserialization capabilities for both models
- Created a CLI interface with placeholder commands
- Implemented colorized logging using structlog and colorama
- Added comprehensive documentation with a README explaining the dual representation approach
- Created unit tests for the key functionality

### QA Testing Guide
To verify this implementation:

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Verify the `arch_blueprint_generator` module is properly structured
   - Check that all required subdirectories and files are present

2. **Relationship Map Model**:
   - Run tests for the Relationship Map to verify all operations
   - Create a simple test graph and verify navigation and query operations

3. **JSON Mirrors Structure**:
   - Test creation and updating of JSON mirrors
   - Verify file hash tracking and change detection

4. **CLI Interface**:
   - Run the CLI with `--help` to verify command structure
   - Test placeholder commands to verify "not yet implemented" responses

5. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd architectum_new
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

### Change Log
