# Story 1.5: Implement Basic File-Based Blueprint Generation

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As an AI agent
- I want to request a basic File-Based Blueprint
- So that I can receive a focused view of specific files regardless of their location in the path structure

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Given a list of valid file paths, the system generates a File-Based Blueprint.
- AC2: The blueprint includes elements from both the Relationship Map and JSON Mirrors.
- AC3: Relationships between files are preserved in the blueprint.
- AC4: Different detail levels produce appropriately varied blueprint contents.
- AC5: Invalid file paths are handled gracefully with appropriate error messages.
- AC6: Testing Requirements:
  - Coverage: At least 80% code coverage for the File-Based Blueprint generation functionality
  - Framework: Implementation using pytest with file fixture sets
  - Snapshot Testing: Create snapshots for various file combinations and detail levels
  - Contract Testing: Verify blueprint outputs meet schema requirements
  - Error Handling: Test responses to invalid paths and other error conditions
  - Detail Level Testing: Verify blueprint content varies appropriately with detail level settings

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Blueprint Base Class Design

Create a robust Blueprint base class that serves as the foundation for all blueprint types:

```python
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional
import json
from enum import Enum

class BlueprintType(Enum):
    FILE = "file"
    COMPONENT = "component"
    FEATURE = "feature"
    TEMPORARY = "temporary"

class Blueprint:
    """Base class for all blueprint types."""
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        relationship_map,
        json_mirrors,
        name: str = "unnamed_blueprint",
        description: str = "",
        blueprint_type: BlueprintType = BlueprintType.FILE
    ):
        self.relationship_map = relationship_map
        self.json_mirrors = json_mirrors
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.type = blueprint_type
        self.content = {}  # Will be populated by subclasses
        
    def to_json(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Convert blueprint to JSON representation."""
        return {
            "name": self.name,
            "description": self.description,
            "type": self.type.value,
            "content": self.content
        }
    
    def to_string(self, indent: int = 2) -> str:
        """Convert blueprint to JSON string."""
        return json.dumps(self.to_json(), indent=indent)
    
    def write_to_file(self, file_path: str) -> None:
        """Write blueprint to file."""
        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(self.to_string())
            
    def validate(self) -> List[str]:
        """
        Validate the blueprint.
        
        Returns:
            List of validation errors (empty if valid)
        """
        errors = []
        
        # Basic validation common to all blueprints
        if not self.name:
            errors.append("Blueprint name cannot be empty")
        
        if not self.content:
            errors.append("Blueprint content cannot be empty")
            
        # Additional validation to be implemented by subclasses
        
        return errors
```
### File-Based Blueprint Implementation

Implement the File-Based Blueprint class that extracts relevant information from both representations:

```python
class FileBasedBlueprint(Blueprint):
    """Blueprint focusing on entire files."""
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        relationship_map,
        json_mirrors,
        file_paths: List[str],
        name: str = "file_based_blueprint",
        description: str = "",
        detail_level_config = None
    ):
        super().__init__(
            relationship_map=relationship_map,
            json_mirrors=json_mirrors,
            name=name,
            description=description,
            blueprint_type=BlueprintType.FILE
        )
        self.file_paths = file_paths
        self.detail_level_config = detail_level_config or DetailLevelConfig()
        
    def generate(self) -> None:
        """Generate blueprint for the specified files."""
        # Validate file paths
        self._validate_file_paths()
        
        # Extract relevant nodes and relationships from Relationship Map
        nodes, relationships = self._extract_from_relationship_map()
        
        # Extract relevant content from JSON Mirrors
        file_contents = self._extract_from_json_mirrors()
        
        # Combine into blueprint content
        self.content = {
            "files": file_contents,
            "nodes": [node.to_dict() for node in nodes],
            "relationships": [rel.to_dict() for rel in relationships]
        }
```    
    def _validate_file_paths(self) -> None:
        """Validate file paths and raise appropriate exceptions for invalid paths."""
        invalid_paths = []
        
        for path in self.file_paths:
            if not self._is_valid_file_path(path):
                invalid_paths.append(path)
                
        if invalid_paths:
            if len(invalid_paths) == len(self.file_paths):
                raise ValueError(f"All specified file paths are invalid: {invalid_paths}")
            else:
                # Log warning but continue with valid paths
                logging.warning(f"Some file paths are invalid and will be skipped: {invalid_paths}")
                self.file_paths = [p for p in self.file_paths if p not in invalid_paths]
    
    def _is_valid_file_path(self, path: str) -> bool:
        """Check if a file path is valid and accessible."""
        # Implementation depends on how files are accessed in the system
        return os.path.isfile(path) and os.access(path, os.R_OK)
    
    def _extract_from_relationship_map(self):
        """
        Extract relevant nodes and relationships from the Relationship Map.
        
        Returns:
            Tuple of (nodes, relationships)
        """
        # Implementation details depend on the Relationship Map API
        # Example implementation:
        nodes = []
        relationships = []

            if file_node:
                nodes.append(file_node)
                
                # Extract contained nodes (functions, classes, etc.)
                contained_nodes = self.relationship_map.get_contained_nodes(file_path, detail_level)
                nodes.extend(contained_nodes)

        return nodes, relationships
    
    def _extract_from_json_mirrors(self):
        """
        Extract relevant content from JSON Mirrors.
        
        Returns:

        # Get detail level for JSON mirrors
        detail_level = self.detail_level_config.json_mirrors
        
        for file_path in self.file_paths:

                file_contents[file_path] = content
        
        return file_contents
```

### Blueprint Factory

Consider implementing a BlueprintFactory to standardize blueprint creation:

```python
class BlueprintFactory:
    """Factory for creating blueprints."""
    
    def __init__(self, relationship_map, json_mirrors):
        self.relationship_map = relationship_map
        self.json_mirrors = json_mirrors
    
    def create_file_blueprint(
        self,
        file_paths: List[str],
        name: str = "file_based_blueprint",
        description: str = "",
        detail_level_config = None
    ) -> FileBasedBlueprint:
        """
        Create a File-Based Blueprint.
        
        Args:
            file_paths: List of file paths to include
            name: Blueprint name
            description: Blueprint description
            detail_level_config: Detail level configuration
            
        Returns:
            Generated File-Based Blueprint
        """
        blueprint = FileBasedBlueprint(
            relationship_map=self.relationship_map,
            json_mirrors=self.json_mirrors,
            file_paths=file_paths,
            name=name,
            description=description,
            detail_level_config=detail_level_config
        )
        
        blueprint.generate()
        return blueprint
```
### Error Handling Strategy

Implement robust error handling for blueprint generation:

1. Validate inputs before processing to provide early feedback
2. Handle partially valid inputs (e.g., some valid files, some invalid)
3. Use specific exception types for different error cases
4. Provide clear error messages with actionable information
5. Log detailed errors for debugging while providing user-friendly messages

### Testing Strategy

Focus on comprehensive testing of blueprint generation:

1. Create test fixtures with known file content and relationships
2. Test with various combinations of files and detail levels
3. Use snapshot testing to verify output format and content
4. Test error handling with invalid inputs
5. Verify that relationships are correctly preserved
6. Ensure detail level settings produce appropriate variations in output

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `GPT-4`

### Completion Notes List
- Implemented Blueprint base class with JSON and XML serialization.
- Added FileBasedBlueprint to merge Relationship Map and JSON Mirrors.
- Integrated detail level configuration and filtering logic.
- Implemented validation for file paths with graceful handling of partial input.
- Added unit and integration tests including snapshot coverage.

### Change Log
- Initial story draft created by POSM
- 2025-05-21: Story implemented and tests added

## QA Testing Guide
1. Run `pytest` in the project root to execute the unit, integration and snapshot tests. All tests should pass.
2. From a Python shell, create a simple blueprint:
   ```python
   from arch_blueprint_generator.models.relationship_map import RelationshipMap
   from arch_blueprint_generator.models.json_mirrors import JSONMirrors
   from arch_blueprint_generator.blueprints.factory import BlueprintFactory

   rm = RelationshipMap()
   jm = JSONMirrors("/path/to/code")
   blueprint = BlueprintFactory.create_file_blueprint(rm, jm, ["example.py"])
   blueprint.generate()
   print(blueprint.to_json())
   ```
3. Verify the output JSON lists the file, its elements and any relationships. Try passing a missing file path to confirm a warning is logged and the blueprint still generates for valid paths.
