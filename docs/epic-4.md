        The authentication system provides secure user login, registration,
        and credential management. It enforces password policies and
        integrates with the session management system.
      usage: |
        Authentication can be triggered from the login page or any
        secured route. The system uses JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only
        cookies for maintaining sessions.
