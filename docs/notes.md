# Terminology Updates Completed

## Overview
The documentation has been updated to ensure consistent terminology throughout the project. The following changes were made:

1. **Blueprint Type Terminology**:
   - Changed "Directory-Based Blueprint" to "Path-Based Blueprint"
   - Changed "Component-Based Blueprint" to "Method-Based Blueprint"
   - Clarified that Feature and Temporary are persistence settings, not distinct blueprint types

2. **Related File Updates**:
   - Updated story-1.2-directory-scan.md to story-1.2-path-scan.md
   - Updated references in index.md to point to the correct file names
   - Updated CLI examples in cli-guide.md to use correct command names

3. **Key Modified Files**:
   - epic-1.md: Changed "Directory Scan" to "Path Scan"
   - epic-3.md: Changed "Component-Based" to "Method-Based"
   - cli-guide.md: Updated command examples to use "path" and "method" instead of "directory" and "component"
   - index.md: Updated navigation links to reflect new terminology
   - story-1.2-path-scan.md: Created as replacement for story-1.2-directory-scan.md

## Additional Notes
- The project-brief.md, prd.md, and architecture.md files were already updated in previous steps.
- The previous story-1.2-directory-scan.md file has been deleted to avoid confusion.
- All changes have been made to ensure consistent terminology across all documentation files.

## Next Steps
The documentation is now ready for review to confirm all terminology is consistent. The next phase should be to generate developer-ready story files based on these updated documents.
