## Dev Technical Guidance

### Cache Implementation

The blueprint cache system should use a combination of in-memory and disk-based caching:

```python
class BlueprintCache:
    """Cache for blueprint instances."""
    
    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 100, persistent: bool = False, cache_dir: Optional[str] = None):
        """
        Initialize the blueprint cache.
        
        Args:
            max_size: Maximum number of blueprints to cache in memory
            persistent: Whether to persist cache to disk
            cache_dir: Directory for persistent cache (if enabled)
        """
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.persistent = persistent
        self.cache_dir = cache_dir or os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), "architectum_cache")
        self.cache = {}  # In-memory cache
        self._initialize()
        
    def _initialize(self):
        """Initialize the cache system."""
        if self.persistent:
            os.makedirs(self.cache_dir, exist_ok=True)
        
    def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[Blueprint]:
        """
        Get a blueprint from the cache.
        
        Args:
            key: Cache key
            
        Returns:
            Cached blueprint, or None if not found
        """
        # Check in-memory cache first
        if key in self.cache:
            # Update LRU status
            return self.cache[key]
            
        # Check disk cache if persistent
        if self.persistent:
            # Load from disk if available
            pass
            
        return None
        
    def put(self, key: str, blueprint: Blueprint) -> None:
        """
        Add a blueprint to the cache.
        
        Args:
            key: Cache key
            blueprint: Blueprint to cache
        """
        # Add to in-memory cache
        self.cache[key] = blueprint
        
        # Enforce size limit (LRU eviction)
        if len(self.cache) > self.max_size:
            # Evict least recently used item
            pass
            
        # Save to disk if persistent
        if self.persistent:
            # Save to disk
            pass
            
    def invalidate(self, key: str) -> None:
        """
        Invalidate a cached blueprint.
        
        Args:
            key: Cache key
        """
        if key in self.cache:
            del self.cache[key]
            
        # Remove from disk if persistent
        if self.persistent:
            # Remove from disk
            pass
            
    def clear(self) -> None:
        """Clear the entire cache."""
        self.cache.clear()
        
        # Clear disk cache if persistent
        if self.persistent:
            # Clear disk cache
            pass
```

### Cache Key Generation

Cache keys should incorporate file paths and modification times:

```python
def generate_cache_key(file_paths: List[str], detail_level: DetailLevel) -> str:
    """
    Generate a cache key for a set of files.
    
    Args:
        file_paths: List of file paths
        detail_level: Detail level for blueprint generation
        
    Returns:
        Cache key string
    """
    # Sort paths for consistency
    sorted_paths = sorted(file_paths)
    
    # Include modification times in key
    components = []
    for path in sorted_paths:
        try:
            mtime = os.path.getmtime(path)
            components.append(f"{path}:{mtime}")
        except (OSError, IOError):
            # If file can't be accessed, use path only
            components.append(path)
    
    # Include detail level in key
    components.append(f"detail:{detail_level.value}")
    
    # Generate hash of components
    key = hashlib.md5(":".join(components).encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
    return key
```

### Performance Optimization Techniques

- **Lazy Loading**: Load file content only when needed
- **Incremental Processing**: Process only changed files
- **Memory Management**: Use generators and iterators for large collections
- **Parallelization**: Use multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks
- **Profiling**: Use cProfile or similar tools to identify bottlenecks
- **Benchmarking**: Create benchmark suite for continuous performance monitoring

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude 3.5 Sonnet`

### Completion Notes List
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented efficient blueprint generation with optimized memory usage
- **File Validation**: Efficient file path validation and filtering to avoid processing invalid files
- **Incremental Processing**: Built-in change detection through existing scanner infrastructure
- **Memory Management**: Efficient cross-file relationship mapping without excessive memory usage
- **Caching Strategy**: Leveraged existing Architectum caching through scanner and representations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of large files and edge cases
- **Integration**: Performance optimizations integrated throughout the blueprint generation pipeline

**Note on Implementation**: Rather than implementing a separate blueprint-specific cache, the performance optimizations were achieved through:
1. Leveraging the existing Architectum scanning and caching infrastructure
2. Efficient file validation and relationship mapping algorithms
3. Memory-optimized serialization processes
4. Integration with the existing `arch sync` command for incremental updates

### QA Testing Guide

**Testing Steps:**

1. **Test Performance with Large Files:**
   ```bash
   # Test with a larger codebase
   architectum blueprint file "src/**/*.py" --detail-level standard
   
   # Measure time and memory usage
   time architectum blueprint file "large_project/**/*.py"
   ```

2. **Test Incremental Updates:**
   ```bash
   # Generate initial blueprint
   architectum blueprint file test.py --output initial.json
   
   # Modify file
   echo "# Modified" >> test.py
   
   # Sync and regenerate
   architectum sync test.py
   architectum blueprint file test.py --output updated.json
   
   # Compare outputs to verify incremental update worked
   ```

3. **Test Memory Efficiency:**
   ```bash
   # Test with many files to verify memory usage doesn't explode
   architectum blueprint file "**/*.py" --detail-level minimal
   ```

4. **Test Error Handling:**
   ```bash
   # Test with mix of valid and invalid files
   architectum blueprint file valid.py nonexistent.py
   
   # Should handle gracefully with warnings
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- Blueprint generation should complete in reasonable time for typical codebases
- Memory usage should remain stable even with large numbers of files
- Incremental updates should be faster than full regeneration
- Invalid files should be handled gracefully without crashing
