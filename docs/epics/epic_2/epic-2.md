# Epic 2: File-Based Blueprint Implementation

**Goal:** To enable Architectum to generate File-Based Blueprints from an explicit list of user-specified files, allowing AI agents and visualization tools to analyze a curated collection of code files at varying levels of detail with relationship mapping across file boundaries.

## Story List

### Story 2.1: Implement Base Blueprint and File-Based Blueprint Models ✅ COMPLETED

- **User Story / Goal:** As an AI agent or developer, I want base blueprint models and file-based blueprint implementation, so that I can generate context-rich representations of selected source files for AI and human comprehension.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Epic 1 must be completed, particularly Story 1.6 (Expose Blueprint Generation via Initial API/CLI)
- **Implementation:** 
  - Base Blueprint abstract class with JSON/XML serialization
  - FileBasedBlueprint implementation with cross-file relationship detection
  - Blueprint factory pattern for dynamic creation
  - Integration with both Relationship Map and JSON Mirrors
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Story 2.2: Implement Blueprint CLI Commands and API ✅ COMPLETED

- **User Story / Goal:** As a developer or AI assistant, I want CLI commands and API endpoints for generating file-based blueprints, so that I can efficiently generate code comprehension blueprints for specific files during development.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Story 2.1 (Base Blueprint and File-Based Blueprint Models) must be completed
- **Implementation:**
  - `architectum blueprint file` command for direct file blueprint generation
  - `architectum blueprint create` command for YAML-based blueprint generation
  - Support for multiple output formats (JSON, XML)
  - Detail level configuration (minimal, standard, detailed)
  - File globbing and validation
  - Comprehensive error handling with colored output

### Story 2.3: Implement Blueprint Serialization and Output Formats ✅ COMPLETED

- **User Story / Goal:** As a developer or AI assistant, I want blueprint serialization with multiple output formats (JSON, XML) with consistent structure, so that generated blueprints can be consumed by various tools and systems for code comprehension.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Story 2.1 (Base Blueprint and File-Based Blueprint Models) must be completed
  - Story 2.2 (CLI Commands and API) must be completed
- **Implementation:**
  - Comprehensive JSON serialization with pretty printing options
  - XML serialization with hierarchical structure
  - UTF-8 encoding and special character handling
  - Memory-efficient serialization for large blueprints
  - Consistent structure across all output formats

### Story 2.4: Implement Blueprint Caching and Performance Optimization ✅ COMPLETED

- **User Story / Goal:** As a developer or AI assistant, I want efficient blueprint generation with caching and performance optimizations, so that I can quickly generate blueprints for frequently referenced files without unnecessary reprocessing.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Story 2.1 (Base Blueprint and File-Based Blueprint Models) must be completed
  - Story 2.2 (CLI Commands and API) must be completed
  - Story 2.3 (Serialization and Output Formats) must be completed
- **Implementation:**
  - Performance-optimized blueprint generation algorithms
  - Memory-efficient file validation and relationship mapping
  - Integration with existing Architectum caching infrastructure
  - Efficient cross-file relationship detection
  - Graceful handling of large files and edge cases

## YAML-Based Blueprint Definition Support

The epic also includes comprehensive YAML-based blueprint definition support:

```yaml
type: file
name: auth-system-blueprint
description: "Core authentication system files"
persistence: temporary  # or persistent
detail_level: standard  # or minimal, detailed

# Files to include
components:
  - file: src/auth/login.js
    elements: []  # Empty means include entire file
  
  - file: src/auth/register.js
    elements: []
```

This functionality enables declarative blueprint specification and is fully integrated with the CLI commands.

## Implementation Sequence ✅ COMPLETED

The implementation of this epic was completed in the following sequence:

1. ✅ **Base Blueprint and File-Based Blueprint Models (Story 2.1)** - Completed
   - Implemented abstract Blueprint base class
   - Created FileBasedBlueprint with full functionality
   - Integrated with both core representations

2. ✅ **CLI Commands and API (Story 2.2)** - Completed  
   - Implemented `architectum blueprint file` command
   - Added `architectum blueprint create` for YAML-based blueprints
   - Full API integration through Blueprint Factory

3. ✅ **Serialization and Output Formats (Story 2.3)** - Completed
   - JSON and XML serialization implemented
   - Pretty printing and format options
   - Character encoding and special character handling

4. ✅ **Performance Optimization (Story 2.4)** - Completed
   - Efficient blueprint generation algorithms
   - Memory optimization for large files
   - Integration with existing caching infrastructure

All functionality from the original story definitions has been successfully implemented and integrated.
