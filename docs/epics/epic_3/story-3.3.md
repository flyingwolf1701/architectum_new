# Story 3.3: Implement Detail Level Support for Method-Based Blueprints

## Status: Approved

## Story

As an AI agent, I want to request Method-Based Blueprints at different detail levels, so that I can balance comprehensiveness against token efficiency for different use cases.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1: Multiple Detail Levels** - Method-Based Blueprints can be generated at different detail levels.

2. **AC2: YAML Detail Level Specification** - Detail level can be specified in YAML definitions:
   ```yaml
   type: method
   name: auth-functions-blueprint
   detail_level: standard  # or minimal, detailed
   components:
     # ...
   ```

3. **AC3: Minimal Detail Level** - Minimal detail level focuses on signatures and immediate relationships.

4. **AC4: Standard Detail Level** - Standard detail level includes type information and parameters.

5. **AC5: Detailed Detail Level** - Detailed detail level includes documentation and implementation insights.

6. **AC6: Adaptive Context Inclusion** - Context inclusion intelligently adapts to the specified detail level.

7. **AC7: Testing Requirements** - Comprehensive testing implemented:
   - At least 80% code coverage for detail level configuration and application
   - Implementation using pytest with parameterized tests for detail levels
   - Snapshot testing comparing blueprints at different detail levels
   - Contract testing to verify blueprint formats meet schema requirements
   - Context testing to verify context inclusion adapts to detail level
   - YAML integration testing for detail level specification

## Dev Technical Guidance

**Key Files to Create/Modify:**
- `arch_blueprint_generator/detail_levels/` - New package for detail level management
- `arch_blueprint_generator/detail_levels/level_processor.py` - Detail level processing
- `arch_blueprint_generator/detail_levels/context_adapter.py` - Context adaptation
- Update `arch_blueprint_generator/blueprints/method_based.py` - Integrate detail levels

**Dependencies:**
- Story 3.1 (Method-Based Blueprint Logic) must be completed
- Story 2.3 (Detail Level Support for File-Based Blueprints) should be completed
- Leverage existing detail level framework from File-Based blueprints
