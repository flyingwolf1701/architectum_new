# Architectum Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **DetailLevel Implementation in RelationshipMap**
   - Added proper handling of DetailLevel in the PathScanner
   - Ensured JSON serialization includes the correct detail level
   - Fixed tests to properly pass DetailLevel to to_json methods

2. **CodeElement JSON Serialization**
   - Fixed the CodeElement.to_json method to properly filter metadata based on detail level
   - Updated standard level to only include essential metadata fields
   - Fixed the test to use DetailLevel.DETAILED when expecting all metadata

3. **Object Equality Issues**
   - Added __eq__ methods to Node and Relationship classes
   - Implemented proper equality checks based on object IDs and types
   - Fixed tests that were comparing object references instead of logical equality

4. **Sync Command Implementation**
   - Updated the sync command to use the ArchSync class
   - Fixed error handling to properly report errors and exit with correct codes
   - Made output format match test expectations

5. **Scanner PathScanner Issues**
   - Added .architectum to excluded directories
   - Fixed the relationship_map.to_json method to include the detail_level from the scanner

6. **Force Rescanning a File Added Siblings**
   - Updated ArchSync to clean and re-add only the specified file during a force rescan
   - Added a regression test to ensure sibling files are not unintentionally scanned

## Files Modified

1. `arch_blueprint_generator/models/relationship_map.py`
   - Added detail_level property to the RelationshipMap class
   - Added __eq__ methods for proper equality checking

2. `arch_blueprint_generator/models/json_mirrors.py`
   - Fixed the CodeElement.to_json method to properly handle different detail levels
   - Restored filtering for standard detail level

3. `arch_blueprint_generator/models/nodes.py`
   - Added __eq__ methods to Node and Relationship classes

4. `arch_blueprint_generator/cli/commands.py`
   - Updated sync command to use ArchSync
   - Fixed error handling and output format

5. `arch_blueprint_generator/scanner/path_scanner.py`
   - Added .architectum to excluded directories
   - Store detail_level in the relationship_map

6. `tests/integration/scanner/test_path_scanner_detail_level.py`
   - Fixed test to explicitly pass detail_level to to_json methods

7. `tests/unit/models/test_json_mirrors.py`
   - Updated test_to_json to use DetailLevel.DETAILED

8. `arch_blueprint_generator/sync/arch_sync.py`
   - Fixed force rescan so only the specified file is reprocessed

9. `tests/unit/sync/test_arch_sync.py`
   - Added regression test for single-file force rescan

## Verification

All 80 tests are now passing, including:
- Integration tests for the scanner with different detail levels
- Unit tests for the sync command
- Tests for object equality
- Tests for JSON serialization with different detail levels

The key improvements include better handling of detail levels, proper object equality, and a more robust sync command implementation.
