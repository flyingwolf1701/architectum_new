# Story 1.2: Implement Basic Path Scan and Representation Generation

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As an AI agent (via Architectum)
- I want to request a path scan and have both representations generated
- So that I can access both navigation-focused and content-focused views of a specified directory

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1 (Core Blueprint Generation Framework) must be completed
- Relationship Map and JSON Mirrors models must be implemented and tested
- Basic CLI structure must be in place
- Parser interfaces must be defined

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: ✅ Given a valid directory path and depth, the system generates both a Relationship Map and JSON Mirrors for the path structure.
- AC2: ✅ Given an invalid directory path, the system returns an appropriate error.
- AC3: ✅ The Relationship Map correctly represents nested structures of directories and files with "contains" relationships.
- AC4: ✅ The JSON Mirrors structure correctly contains JSON representations for each source file.
- AC5: ✅ Scan depth 0 correctly scans all subdirectories and files.
- AC6: ✅ Scan depth 1 correctly scans only the immediate files and folders in the specified directory.
- AC7: ✅ Test coverage is comprehensive with thorough tests for the path traversal and representation generation functionality.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- Use mock file systems for testing to avoid external dependencies
- Ensure consistent handling of path separators across operating systems
- Use the pathlib library for path manipulations
- Consider performance implications for large directory structures
- Implement directory scanning as an iterator for memory efficiency
- Use proper error handling and validation

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude 3.7 Sonnet`

### Completion Notes List
- Created a new `scanner` module with the `PathScanner` class that handles file system traversal
- Implemented depth-limited scanning with filtering for excluded patterns
- Added support for generating both representations (relationship map and JSON mirrors)
- Created a comprehensive test suite to verify functionality
- Added a new CLI command `arch scan` to expose the functionality to users
- Implemented proper error handling for invalid paths and other edge cases
- Added binary file detection to handle both text and binary files
- Ensured proper filtering of excluded directories like `.git` and `__pycache__`

### QA Testing Guide

To verify the path scanning functionality:

1. **Basic Path Scanning:**
   ```bash
   arch scan .
   ```
   - Should display information about the scan results including node and relationship counts
   - Verify the scan completes without errors

2. **Path Scanning with Depth Limit:**
   ```bash
   arch scan . --depth 1
   ```
   - Should only scan the top-level directory and its immediate contents
   - Verify subdirectories aren't recursively scanned

3. **Invalid Path Testing:**
   ```bash
   arch scan nonexistent_directory
   ```
   - Should display an appropriate error message
   - Verify the error is handled gracefully without crashing

4. **Output File Testing:**
   ```bash
   arch scan . --output scan_results
   ```
   - Should create scan_results directory with relationship_map.json and json_mirrors_paths.json
   - Verify JSON mirrors are stored in the .architectum/mirrors directory
   - Check that the output files have valid JSON content

5. **Custom Exclusion Patterns:**
   ```bash
   arch scan . --exclude node_modules --exclude .venv
   ```
   - Should skip directories that match the exclusion patterns
   - Verify excluded directories are not present in the relationship map

6. **Performance Testing:**
   - Run scan on a large codebase to verify performance
   - Check memory usage during scan of large directories
   - Verify scan completes in a reasonable time for large codebases

7. **Binary vs Text File Handling:**
   - Create a directory with both text and binary files
   - Verify binary files are properly detected
   - Check that the scanner correctly processes both types

8. **Edge Case Testing:**
   - Test with a directory containing special characters in filenames
   - Verify handling of very deep directory structures (10+ levels)
   - Test with empty directories
   - Check handling of symbolic links and file permissions

These tests should verify that the Path Scanner functionality meets all acceptance criteria and handles a variety of real-world scenarios correctly.

### Change Log

- Updated terminology from "directory scan" to "path scan" for consistency
- Implemented core path scanning functionality
- Added CLI integration for the path scanner
- Created comprehensive tests for the new functionality
- Updated story status to completed
- Added QA Testing Guide
