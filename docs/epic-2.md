# Epic 2: File-Based Blueprint Implementation

## Overview

This epic focuses on implementing the File-Based Blueprint functionality, which is the first concrete blueprint type in the Architectum system. File-Based Blueprints combine selected files for comprehensive context, enabling developers and AI assistants to understand code relationships and structure more effectively.

Building on the core infrastructure established in Epic 1, this epic will create the blueprint models, CLI commands, serialization formats, and performance optimizations needed to generate useful blueprints from source files.

## Goals

- Implement the File-Based Blueprint model extending the base Blueprint class
- Create CLI commands and API endpoints for generating file-based blueprints
- Develop serialization mechanisms for multiple output formats (JSON, XML)
- Implement caching and performance optimization for efficient blueprint generation

## User Stories

1. [Story 2.1](./epic_2/story-2.1.md): Implement Base Blueprint and File-Based Blueprint Models
   - Implement the base Blueprint class and File-Based Blueprint
   - Setup integration with core representations (Relationship Map and JSON Mirrors)
   - Create validation and error handling for blueprint operations

2. [Story 2.2](./epic_2/story-2.2.md): Implement Blueprint CLI Commands and API
   - Enhance the existing CLI blueprint command to support file-based blueprints
   - Create API functions for programmatic blueprint generation
   - Implement parameter validation and error handling

3. [Story 2.3](./epic_2/story-2.3.md): Implement Blueprint Serialization and Output Formats
   - Develop serialization framework for different output formats
   - Implement JSON and XML formatters with consistent structure
   - Add optional HTML visualization for human consumption

4. [Story 2.4](./epic_2/story-2.4.md): Implement Blueprint Caching and Performance Optimization
   - Create blueprint caching system with appropriate invalidation strategies
   - Optimize performance for large files and projects
   - Implement incremental updates to avoid unnecessary reprocessing

## Technical Scope

- **Blueprint Base Class**: Create foundation for all blueprint types with core functionality
- **File-Based Blueprint**: Implement specialized blueprint focusing on entire files
- **CLI & API**: Enhance command-line interface and programmatic API for blueprint generation
- **Serialization**: Develop formatters for JSON, XML, and optionally HTML output
- **Caching**: Implement in-memory and persistent caching with smart invalidation
- **Performance**: Optimize for efficient processing of large projects and files

## Success Criteria

- File-Based Blueprints can be generated from multiple files
- Blueprint outputs include comprehensive information from both core representations
- Multiple output formats (JSON, XML) are supported with consistent structure
- Blueprint generation performance is optimized with effective caching
- CLI commands and API functions provide a user-friendly interface

## Dependencies

- Epic 1: Core Blueprint Generation Framework must be completed

## Estimated Effort

- Story 2.1: 8 story points
- Story 2.2: 5 story points  
- Story 2.3: 5 story points
- Story 2.4: 5 story points

Total: 23 story points

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Performance issues with large files | High | Implement incremental processing, caching, and optimization techniques |
| Complexity of blueprint structure | Medium | Create comprehensive documentation and examples for developers |
| Serialization format limitations | Medium | Design flexible output formats with extensibility in mind |
| Memory consumption for large projects | High | Implement memory-efficient algorithms and streaming processing |
